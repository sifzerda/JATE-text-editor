## 4. Installation

- <span style="color:yellow">npm install i</span> to get dependencies
- <span style="color:yellow">npm run build</span> to create a local production build of the app (inside 'dist' folder)
- <span style="color:yellow">npm run start:dev</span> for service worker precaching

## 5. Usage

This is a text editor which has been updated to use PWA strategies to provide an accessible, fast and secure program for users. It uses webpack to enhance optimization, IndexedDB for storage and service workers to provide offline accessibility.
